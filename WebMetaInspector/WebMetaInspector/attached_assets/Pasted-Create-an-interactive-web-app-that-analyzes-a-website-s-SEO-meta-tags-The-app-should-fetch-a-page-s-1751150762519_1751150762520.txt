Create an interactive web app that analyzes a website's SEO meta tags. The app should fetch a page's HTML and visually display important SEO tags like <title>, <meta name="description">, Open Graph, and Twitter Cards. It should also provide a simulated preview of how the site looks in Google Search and on social media, with an overall SEO score out of 100.

🎯 Project Goals
Let users input any public website URL

Fetch and parse the HTML from that URL

Extract core SEO tags (title, description, Open Graph, Twitter)

Provide a visual preview of how the site looks on:

Google Search

Facebook / LinkedIn (Open Graph)

Twitter (Twitter Card)

Assign an SEO score out of 100 based on tag presence & quality

Provide clear feedback for any missing or weak tags

🧰 Suggested Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML + CSS + JavaScript (or React)

Backend: Node.js + Express (to handle URL requests + parsing)

HTML Parsing: Cheerio or JSDOM

Preview Rendering: Custom styled components

🪜 Step-by-Step Milestones
